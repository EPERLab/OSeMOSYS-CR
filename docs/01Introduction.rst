.. Title:

The OSeMOSYS – CR model
=====================================



Project overview
------------------------------------

This work is part of the “Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project in Latin America and the Caribbean
(DDPP-LAC)” which is coordinated by the Institute for Sustainable Development and International
Relations (IDDRI) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).

The project involves six different teams, and each team is formed by experts from a Latin American
(LA) country (Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru) and experts from other
countries (France, USA, Sweden and Brazil). The main purpose of these alliances is to transfer
capacities from one country to another, while engaging with policy makers to address a modeling
aspect of local importance. The Costa Rican team is composed by researchers from the University of
Costa Rica (UCR) and the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm.
While each team has its own goals, the common objectives of this project are:
• Provide support and training to teams of researchers in LAC in the use of new models, relying
on best practices drawn by more advanced teams of researchers.
• Demonstrate these models to local policymakers with an emphasis on a specific policy question
of local importance.
• Develop long-term decarbonization pathways that can inform a transparent public debate on
NDC planning.
• Develop a collaborative community of climate policy modelers in LAC capable of continually
developing their expertise
The Costa Rican team focuses on the development of an Energy System Optimization Model (ESOM) for its
energy system, giving a particular attention to the electricity and the transport sectors, to establish
the most cost-effective technological transition towards a deep decarbonization, while assessing the
corresponding impacts over the economy and society. The project also aims to promote a dialogue on
the national policy related to the future concerning the decarbonization of the economy.

Motivation and problem statement
------------------------------------

Costa Rica is a Latin American country worldwide known for its environmental protection, political,
social and economic stability, and renewable electricity generation. Despite these achievements, there
are many challenges to tackle in the energy sector, especially when it concerns transportation.
According to the 2016’s National Energy Balance [1], in the country’s energy mix, fossil fuels are
the main energy source with an overwhelming 62.6%. From that share the transport sector accounts
for 82.8% and at the same time correspond to approximately 44 % of national Green House Gases
(GHG) emissions [2].
The previously mentioned challenges are exacerbated by the international and national commitments
that Costa Rica has acquired, such as its ambitious National Determinate Contributions (NDCs)
[3]. Therefore, it is crucial for the country to further transform the energy sector by reducing oil consumption
through alternative sources, and create a more sustainable energy mix.
In this context, the main purpose of the project is to develop an ESOM to characterize the transport
and electricity sectors. The objective is to analyze the energy system to identify decarbonization
pathways scenarios focusing on the transport sector through the examination of transport scenarios
with different vectors of final energy demand.
The modeling tool chosen was the Open Source energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS) [4], an
optimization software for long-term energy planning. It is an open source model structured in blocks
of functionality that allows easy modifications to the code, providing a great flexibility for the creative
process of the solution.
The produced IAM will support policymakers in Costa Rica understanding the most suitable
strategies to achieve a deep decarbonization. It could also be used to decide what type of technologies
(in the electricity and transport sector) should be incentivized for the different scenarios. In addition,
the project aims to produce a scalable ESOM that will remain in the government for different energyrelated
decisions. The project tries to understand the percentage of existing fossil-based taxis, buses,
and light-duty vehicles that should be changed to other more efficient technologies (electric, biogas,
etc.). While the previous example applies for the transport sector, similar conclusions are expected
in terms of the electricity sector
