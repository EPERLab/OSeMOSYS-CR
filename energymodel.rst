The OSeMOSYS â€“ CR Energy model Documentation
=======================================

This documentation has been structured to provide  an overview of the energy sector in Costa Rica, present the model structure, give synthesis regarding assumptions, and support the numerical inputs for the sets, parameters, and scenario building.   

Energy balance of Costa Rica
+++++++++

The energy balance is the most important source of data for the model. It is prepared for the Secretariat of Planning of the Energy Subsector (SEPSE). The analysis concentrates and processes data from institutions such as The Costa Rica Institute of Electricity (ICE), the Costa Rican Petroleum Refinery (RECOPE) and the National Center for Energy Control (CENCE). The information is usually presented annually with excel books and a SANKEY diagram. Figure 1 shows the diagram for 2011.  As can be noted, in Costa Rica the fossil fuels are completely imported, and the electricity is generated almost completely with renewable sources. Figure 2 shows the historical trending and the general distribution for 2016. 

General model structure 
+++++++++

The entire Costa Rican energy sector is modeled in OSeMOSYS. However, only the transport and electricity sectors are subject to linear optimization, while other energy sources and demands are only represented with trends to account for their possible greenhouse gases (GHG) contributions. The overall structure of the model can be represented by the reference energy system shown in Figure 3. The primary energy supply consists of four main sources: renewable, imports of fossil fuels, biomass and electricity imports. These sources are transformed to different demands including industrial, residential and commercial requirements, and the transport of passengers and cargo. 

In OSeMOSYS-CR, the connection between the electricity and transport sectors is crucial for understanding the technological transition of fossil-powered vehicles to other lower or zero carbon emissions. In the model, all fuels and technologies are incorporated to OSeMOSYS taking into account other sets, such as temporary divisions and emission factors, as well as the parameters. The latter are classified, among others, into costs, activity levels and infrastructure capabilities. The establishment of these parameters was done after a data processing and a review of the available national energy information. The following table summarizes the main souces of data for OSeMOSYS-CR:

Sets 
+++++++++

The sets are responsible for defining the structure of the model (i.e. temporal space, geographic space, elements of the system, etc.), the group of sets include: years, fuels, technologies, emissions and modes of operation. Each parameter, as it going to be further explained, is dependent of one or more sets. This sections presents the sets composing the current version of OSeMOSYS-CR.  

Year
---------

This corresponds to the period of analysis. For OSeMOSYS-CR it is from 2018 to 2055. Five additional years are added in order to extend the optimization process.  Therefore, decisions right before 2050 (i.e. national decarbonisation target) will not be affected by the model considering it is the last year. 

Fuels
---------

Figure 6 shows the different levels and transformations fuels go through, and their relations with some technologies. Groups E0, E1, E3, E4, E5, and E6 are crucial elements of the current supply chain, while E8 and E9 are modeled for control purposes.  Groups E9, E10  and E11 complement the model to enable the inclusion of hydrogen and infrastructure.  

The following table presents a synthesis of the included groups of commodities, including a brief description and examples.  See Annex 2 for the whole list of fuels.
